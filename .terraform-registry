Request: Remove the following module from the Terraform Registry because we made a mistake in our code which corrupted the entry. Now we are unable to publish the module at all. Once removed we can publish the module again with the corrected code.
Registry Link: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/duplocloud/addons/kubernetes/latest
